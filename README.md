# Unity FSM Framework

Welcome to the Unity Finite State Machine (FSM) Framework! This framework is designed to simplify the process of implementing AI-driven behavior for enemies and other entities within Unity projects. The FSM framework provides a user-friendly graphical interface and a set of flexible tools to create, manage, and visualize state-based behaviors with minimal programming.

## Overview

The Unity FSM Framework allows developers to:
- **Create and Manage AI**: Develop sophisticated AI behaviors by defining states, transitions, and conditions that drive enemy and NPC interactions.
- **Customizable State Nodes**: Use and configure a wide variety of prebuilt nodes, including custom states and transition nodes, to build behaviors tailored to any gameplay.
- **Seamless Integration with Unity Inspector**: Edit, fine-tune, and manage FSM properties directly within the Unity Inspector.
- **Enhanced Visual Editor**: Design AI visually with an intuitive node-based editor, making it easier to understand and modify complex behaviors.
- **Custom Animations and Models**: Import custom models and animations, allowing for detailed and unique character behaviors.

This framework aims to help both beginner and experienced developers focus more on gameplay design without needing advanced programming knowledge.

## Installation

1. Download the latest version of `FsmUnityFramework.unitypackage` from the [Releases](https://github.com/arnaucarbonell/fsm-unity-framework/releases) section of this repository.
2. Import the package into your Unity project by double-clicking on the `.unitypackage` file or using Unityâ€™s package import functionality.
3. (Optional) For enhanced visual quality, ensure your project has **URP (Universal Render Pipeline)** installed.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for the Unity FSM Framework is available on our documentation website. It includes tutorials, API references, and example setups to help you get started quickly and effectively.

## Getting Started

After installation, open the FSM tool in Unity to start creating states and transitions. You can use the visual editor to design behaviors or refer to the documentation for step-by-step tutorials on setting up FSMs for various types of gameplay scenarios.

## Features

- **Intuitive Graphical Interface** for designing and managing state-based AI.
- **Predefined and Customizable Nodes** to easily implement complex AI logic.
- **Inspector Integration** for fine-grained control of states and transitions.
- **Examples and Templates** to quickly set up common AI behaviors like patrol, chase, attack, and more.
