<h1 id="universal-render-pipeline-asset">Universal Render Pipeline Asset</h1>

<p>Any Unity project that uses the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) must have a URP Asset to configure the settings. When you create a project using the URP template, Unity creates the URP Assets in the <strong>Settings</strong> project folder and assigns them in Project Settings. If you are migrating an existing project to URP, you need to <a href="InstallURPIntoAProject.html">create a URP Asset and assign the asset in the Graphics settings</a>.</p>
<p>The URP Asset controls several graphical features and quality settings for the Universal Render Pipeline.  It is a scriptable object that inherits from ‘RenderPipelineAsset’. When you assign the asset in the Graphics settings, Unity switches from the built-in render pipeline to the URP. You can then adjust the corresponding settings directly in the URP, instead of looking for them elsewhere.</p>
<p>You can have multiple URP assets and switch between them. For example, you can have one with Shadows on and one with Shadows off. If you switch between the assets to see the effects, you don’t have to manually toggle the corresponding settings for shadows every time. You cannot, however, switch between HDRP/SRP and URP assets, as the
render pipelines are incompatible.</p>
<h2 id="ui-overview">UI overview</h2>
<p>In the URP, you can configure settings for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#rendering"><strong>Rendering</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="#quality"><strong>Quality</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="#lighting"><strong>Lighting</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="#shadows"><strong>Shadows</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="#post-processing"><strong>Post-processing</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="#adaptive-performance"><strong>Adaptive Performance</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have the experimental 2D Renderer enabled (menu: <strong>Graphics Settings</strong> &gt; add the 2D Renderer Asset under <strong>Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings</strong>), some of the options related to 3D rendering in the URP Asset don't have any impact on your final app or game.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-show-additional-properties">How to show Additional Properties</h3>
<p>Unity does not show certain advanced properties in the URP Asset by default. To see all available properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the URP Asset, in any section, click the vertical ellipsis icon (⋮) and select <strong>Show Additional Properties</strong></p>
<p><img src="Images/settings-general/show-additional-properties.png" alt="Show Additional Properties"></p>
<p>Unity shows all available properties in the current section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To show all additional properties in all sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click the vertical ellipsis icon (⋮) and select <strong>Show All Additional Properties</strong>. Unity opens the <strong>Core Render Pipeline</strong> section in the <strong>Preferences</strong> window.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the property <strong>Additional Properties &gt; Visibility</strong>, select <strong>All Visible</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="Images/settings-general/show-all-additional-properties.png" alt="Additional Properties &gt; Visibility &gt; All Visible"></p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Property</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Depth Texture</strong></td>
<td>Enables URP to create a <code>_CameraDepthTexture</code>. URP then uses this <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-DepthTextures.html">depth texture</a> by default for all Cameras in your Scene. You can override this for individual cameras in the <a href="camera-component-reference.html">Camera Inspector</a>. If you enable this setting, URP uses more memory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Opaque Texture</strong></td>
<td>Enable this to create a <code>_CameraOpaqueTexture</code> as default for all cameras in your Scene. This works like the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-GrabPass.html">GrabPass</a> in the built-in render pipeline. The <strong>Opaque Texture</strong> provides a snapshot of the scene right before URP renders any transparent meshes. You can use this in transparent Shaders to create effects like frosted glass, water refraction, or heat waves. You can override this for individual cameras in the <a href="camera-component-reference.html">Camera Inspector</a>. If you enable this setting, URP uses more memory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Opaque Downsampling</strong></td>
<td>Set the sampling mode on the opaque texture to one of the following:<br><strong>None</strong>:  Produces a copy of the opaque pass in the same resolution as the camera.<br><strong>2x Bilinear</strong>: Produces a half-resolution image with bilinear filtering.<br><strong>4x Box</strong>: Produces a quarter-resolution image with box filtering. This produces a softly blurred copy.<br><strong>4x Bilinear</strong>: Produces a quarter-resolution image with bi-linear filtering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Terrain Holes</strong></td>
<td>If you disable this option, URP removes all Terrain hole Shader variants when you build for the Unity Player, which decreases build time and reduces processing time on the GPU.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>SRP Batcher</strong></td>
<td>Check this box to enable the SRP Batcher. This is useful if you have many different Materials that use the same Shader. The SRP Batcher is an inner loop that speeds up CPU rendering without affecting GPU performance. When you use the SRP Batcher, it replaces the SRP rendering code inner loop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Dynamic Batching</strong></td>
<td>Enable <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/DrawCallBatching.html">Dynamic Batching</a>, to make the render pipeline automatically batch small dynamic objects that share the same Material. This is useful for platforms and graphics APIs that do not support GPU instancing. If your targeted hardware does support GPU instancing, disable <strong>Dynamic Batching</strong>. You can change this at run time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Debug Level</strong></td>
<td>Set the level of debug information that the render pipeline generates. The values are:<br><strong>Disabled</strong>:  Debugging is disabled. This is the default.<br><strong>Profiling</strong>: Makes the render pipeline provide detailed information tags, which you can see in the FrameDebugger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Shader Variant Log Level</strong></td>
<td>Set the level of information about Shader Stripping and Shader Variants you want to display when Unity finishes a build. Values are:<br> <strong>Disabled</strong>: Unity doesn’t log anything.<br><strong>Only Universal</strong>: Unity logs information for all of the <a href="shaders-in-universalrp.html">URP Shaders</a>.<br><strong>All</strong>: Unity logs information for all Shaders in your build.<br> You can see the information in Console panel when your build has finished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Store Actions</strong></td>
<td>Defines if Unity discards or stores the render targets of the DrawObjects Passes. Selecting the <strong>Store</strong> option significantly increases the memory bandwidth on mobile and tile-based GPUs.<br><strong>Auto</strong>: Unity uses the <strong>Discard</strong> option by default, and falls back to the <strong>Store</strong> option if it detects any injected Passes.<br><strong>Discard</strong>:  Unity discards the render targets of render Passes that are not reused later (lower memory bandwidth).<br><strong>Store</strong>: Unity stores all render targets of each Pass (higher memory bandwidth).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="quality">Quality</h3>
<p>These settings control the quality level of the URP. This is where you can make performance better on lower-end hardware or make graphics look better on  higher-end hardware.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you want to have different settings for different hardware, you can configure these settings across multiple Universal Render Pipeline assets, and switch them out as needed.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>HDR</strong></td>
<td>Enable this to allow rendering in High Dynamic Range (HDR) by default for every camera in your Scene. With HDR, the brightest part of the image can be greater than 1. This gives you a wider range of light intensities, so your lighting looks more realistic. With it, you can still see details and experience less saturation even with bright light. This is useful if you want a wide range of lighting or to use <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PostProcessing-Bloom.html">bloom</a> effects. If you’re targeting lower-end hardware, you can disable this to skip HDR calculations and get better performance. You can override this for individual cameras in the Camera Inspector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>    HDR Precision</td>
<td>The precision of the Camera color buffer in HDR rendering. The 64 bit precision lets you avoid banding artifacts, but requires higher bandwidth and might make sampling slower. Default value: 32 bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Anti Aliasing (MSAA)</strong></td>
<td>Use <a href="anti-aliasing.html#msaa">Multisample Anti-aliasing</a> by default for every Camera in your Scene while rendering. This softens edges of your geometry, so they’re not jagged or flickering. In the drop-down menu, select how many samples to use per pixel: <strong>2x</strong>, <strong>4x</strong>, or <strong>8x</strong>. The more samples you choose, the smoother your object edges are. If you want to skip MSAA calculations, or you don’t need them in a 2D game, select <strong>Disabled</strong>. You can override this for individual cameras in the Camera Inspector.<br><strong>Note:</strong> On mobile platforms that do not support the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderBufferStoreAction.StoreAndResolve.html">StoreAndResolve</a> store action, if <strong>Opaque Texture</strong> is selected in the URP asset, Unity ignores the <strong>Anti Aliasing (MSAA)</strong> property at runtime (as if Anti Aliasing (MSAA) is set to Disabled).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Render Scale</strong></td>
<td>This slider scales the render target resolution (not the resolution of your current device). Use this when you want to render at a smaller resolution for performance reasons or to upscale rendering to improve quality.  This only scales the game rendering. UI rendering is left at the native resolution for the device.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Upscaling Filter</strong></td>
<td>Select which image filter Unity uses when performing the upscaling. Unity performs upscaling when the Render Scale value is less than 1.0.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>    <strong>Automatic</strong></td>
<td>Unity selects one of the filtering options based on the Render Scale value and the current screen resolution. If integer scaling is possible, Unity selects the Nearest-Neighbor option, otherwise Unity selects the Bilinear option.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>    <strong>Bilinear</strong></td>
<td>Unity uses the bilinear or linear filtering provided by the graphics API.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>    <strong>Nearest-Neighbor</strong></td>
<td>Unity uses the nearest-neighbor or point sampling filtering provided by the graphics API.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>    <strong>FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0</strong></td>
<td>Unity uses the AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0 (FSR) technique to perform upscaling.<br>Unlike the other Upscaling Filter options, this filter remains active even at a Render Scale value of 1.0. This filter can still improve image quality even when no scaling is occurring. This also makes the transition between scale values 0.99 and 1.0 less noticeable in cases where dynamic resolution scaling is active.<br><strong>Note</strong>: This filter is only supported on devices that support Unity shader model 4.5 or higher. On devices that do not support Unity shader model 4.5, Unity uses the <strong>Automatic</strong> option instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>    <strong>Override FSR Sharpness</strong></td>
<td>Unity shows this check box when you select the FSR filter. Selecting this check box lets you specify the intensity of the FSR sharpening pass.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>    <strong>FSR Sharpness</strong></td>
<td>Specify the intensity of the FSR sharpening pass. A value of 0.0 provides no sharpening, a value of 1.0 provides maximum sharpness. This option has no effect when FSR is not the active upscaling filter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong><a name="lod-cross-fade"></a>LOD Cross Fade</strong></td>
<td>Use this property to enable or disable the LOD cross-fade. If you disable this option, URP removes all LOD cross-fade shader variants when you build the Unity Player, which decreases the build time . If you target a low-end mobile platform, disable this setting so URP doesn't use alpha testing to fade level of detail (LOD) meshes in and out, which reduces processing time on the GPU.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>LOD Cross Fade Dithering Type</strong></td>
<td>When an <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-LODGroup.html">LOD group</a> has <strong>Fade Mode</strong> set to <strong>Cross Fade</strong>, Unity renders the Renderer's LOD meshes with cross-fade blending between them using alpha testing. This property defines the type of LOD cross-fade.<br>Options:<br><strong>Bayer Matrix</strong>: better performance than the Blue Noise option, but has a repetitive pattern.<br><strong>Blue Noise</strong>: uses a precomputed blue noise texture and provides a better look than the Bayer Matrix option, but has a slightly higher performance cost.</td>

<td>These settings affect the main <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Lighting.html">Directional Light</a> in your Scene. You can select this by assigning it as a <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GlobalIllumination.html">Sun Source</a> in the Lighting Inspector. If you don’t assign a sun source, the URP treats the brightest directional light in the Scene as the main light. You can choose between <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightPerformance.html">Pixel Lighting</a> and <em>None</em>. If you choose None, URP doesn’t render a main light,  even if you’ve set a sun source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Cast Shadows</strong></td>
<td>Check this box to make the main light cast shadows in your Scene. On lower-end platforms, you can disable this setting to reduce how much memory URP uses, and reduce processing time on the CPU and the GPU.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Shadow Resolution</strong></td>
<td>This controls how large the shadow map texture for the main light is. High resolutions give sharper, more detailed shadows. If memory or rendering time is an issue, try a lower resolution.</td>

<td>With this option selected, you can configure certain Lights to affect only specific GameObjects. For more information on Rendering Layers and how to use them, see the page <a href="features/rendering-layers.html">Rendering Layers</a>. If you enable this setting and you use the Deferred rendering path, URP uses more memory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Light Cookies</strong></td>
<td>When enabled, URP includes light cookie shader variants in the build. If you enable this setting, URP uses more memory. Refer to <a href="light-component.html">Light component reference</a> for more information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Additional Lights</strong></td>
<td>Choose whether to add additional lights that supplement your main light. Choose between <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightPerformance.html">Per Vertex</a>, <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightPerformance.html">Per Pixel</a>, or <strong>Disabled</strong>. To reduce processing time on the GPU, set to <strong>Disabled</strong>, or <strong>Per Vertex</strong> if you use the Forward or Forward+ rendering path.</td>

<td><strong>Per Object Limit</strong></td>
<td>This slider sets the limit for how many additional lights can affect each GameObject.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Cast Shadows</strong></td>
<td>Check this box to make the additional lights cast shadows in your Scene.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Shadow Atlas Resolution</strong></td>
<td>Control the size of the textures that cast directional shadows for the additional lights. This is a sprite atlas that packs up to 16 shadow maps. High resolutions give sharper, more detailed shadows. If memory or rendering time is an issue, try a lower resolution.</td>

<td>The number of <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/shadow-cascades.html">shadow cascades</a>. With shadow cascades, you can avoid crude shadows close to the Camera and keep the Shadow Resolution reasonably low. For more information, see the page <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/shadow-cascades.html">Shadow Cascades</a>. Increasing the number of cascades reduces the performance.
